___


Starter code taken from udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

In this project I had changed the static page given by udacity to a dynamic website

I had used the Java Script to add the sections contents dynamically by calling the Fumctions I had made then add the section name to the nav bar

While scrolling or clicking on a  name of the section the view port will be for this section only and the section number will be active.
